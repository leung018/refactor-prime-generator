# Refactor of PrimeGenerator from Clean Code

This project is a refactored version of PrimeGenerator found in Chapter 4 of the book _Clean Code_. _Clean Code_ is written by Uncle Bob.

## Motivation

As a reader of _Clean Code_, it was my first tutor to coding practices. However, I recently read _A Philosophy of Software Design_, written by John Ousterhout, which introduced some meaningful perspectives different from _Clean Code_. One such idea is that if we find ourselves flipping back and forth between the parent and child code to understand how they work together after splitting the code, that is a red flag indicating that the split was probably a bad idea.

When I read PrimeGenerator in Chapter 4 of _Clean Code_, I had a similar feeling. I wondered if some splits made the code harder to understand, so I decided to refactor it in the way presented in this repository.

Although I try to refactor some code by Uncle Bob, I really appreciate he has written _Clean Code_ to teach us a lot.

## Discussion

If you have any suggestions or comments on the refactored code, feel free to leave them on the repository's issues or pull requests.
